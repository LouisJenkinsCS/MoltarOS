# MoltarOS

MoltarOS will be a simple and minimal implementation of an Operating System, developed initially using [OSDev Tutorials](http://wiki.osdev.org/Tutorials), and later with me implementing things on my own.

MoltarOS is not intended to be a commercial or competitive operating system, it is merely an attempt at a more academic minimal but OS, with the goal to teach myself, the sole developer, the ins and outs of how an Operating System works. The features I plan to implement are...

1) EXT2 Filesystem

2) Basic Keyboard driver

3) Basic interactive shell

4) Simplistic yet effective CPU scheduling and multitasking

5) Multithreading primitives and message-passing 

6) Basic Network Stack, enough to implement BSD sockets

7) Memory allocation and implementation of a heap

8) ELF support


These will, without a doubt, take a very long time, and I may not ever finish them, however if and when I do, another notable goal would be to implement support for X windows server for a basic GUI.
